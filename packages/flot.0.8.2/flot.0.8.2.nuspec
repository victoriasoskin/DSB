### Changes ###

 - Added a plot.destroy method as a way to free memory when emptying the plot
   placeholder and then re-using it for some other purpose.
   (patch by Thodoris Greasidis, issue #1129, pull request #1130)

 - Added a table of contents and PLUGINS link to the API documentation.
   (patches by Brian Peiris, pull requests #1064 and #1127)

 - Added Ruby code examples for time conversion.
   (patch by Mike Połtyn, pull request #1182)

 - Minor improvements to API.md and README.md.
   (patches by Patrik Ragnarsson, pull requests #1085 and #1086)

 - Updated inlined jQuery Resize to the latest version to fix errors.
   (reported by Matthew Sabol and sloker, issues #997 ad #1081)

### Bug fixes ###

 - Fixed an unexpected change in behavior that resulted in duplicate tick
   labels when using a plugin, like flot-tickrotor, that overrode tick labels.
   (patch by Mark Cote, pull request #1091)

 - Fixed a regression from 0.7 where axis labels were given the wrong width,
   causing them to overlap at certain scales and ignore the labelWidth option.
   (patch by Benjamin Gram, pull request #1177)

 - Fixed a bug where the second axis in an xaxes/yaxes array incorrectly had
   its 'innermost' property set to false or undefined, even if it was on the
   other side of the plot from the first axis. This resulted in the axis bar
   being visible when it shouldn't have been, which was especially obvious
   when the grid had a left/right border width of zero.
   (reported by Teq1, fix researched by ryleyb, issue #1056)

 - Fixed an error when using a placeholder that has no font-size property.
   (patch by Craig Oldford, pull request #1135)

 - Fixed a regression from 0.7 where nulls at the end of a series were ignored
   for purposes of determing the range of the x-axis.
   (reported by Munsifali Rashid, issue #1095)

 - If a font size is provided, base the default lineHeight on that size rather
   that the font size of the plot placeholder, which may be very different.
   (reported by Daniel Hoffmann Bernardes, issue #1131, pull request #1199)

 - Fix broken highlighting for right-aligned bars.
   (reported by BeWiBu and Mihai Stanciu, issues #975 and #1093, with further
   assistance by Eric Byers, pull request #1120)

 - Prevent white circles from sometimes showing up inside of pie charts.
   (reported by Pierre Dubois and Jack Klink, issues #1128 and #1073)

 - Label formatting no longer breaks when a page contains multiple pie charts.
   (reported by Brend Wanders, issue #1055)

 - When using multiple axes on opposite sides of the plot, the innermost axis
   coming later in the list no longer has its bar drawn incorrectly.
   (reported by ryleyb, issue #1056)

 - When removing series labels and redrawing the plot, the legend now updates
   correctly even when using an external container.
   (patch by Luis Silva, issue #1159, pull request #1160)

 - The pie plugin no longer ignores the value of the left offset option.
   (reported by melanker, issue #1136)

 - Fixed a regression from 0.7, where extra padding was added unnecessarily to
   sides of the plot where there was no last tick label.
   (reported by sknob001, issue #1048, pull request #1200)

 - Fixed incorrect tooltip behavior in the interacting example.
   (patch by cleroux, issue #686, pull request #1074)

 - Fixed an error in CSS color extraction with elements outside the DOM.
   (patch by execjosh, pull request #1084)

 - Fixed :not selector error when using jQuery without Sizzle.
   (patch by Anthony Ryan, pull request #1180)

 - Worked around a browser issue that caused bars to appear un-filled.
